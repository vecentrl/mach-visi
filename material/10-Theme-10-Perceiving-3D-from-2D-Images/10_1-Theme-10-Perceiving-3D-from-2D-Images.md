## Theme 10 – Perceiving 3D from 2D Images  

### Preview  
In this theme, we explore how a 2D image (or a pair of images) can provide information about the **3D structure of the world**. While a single image flattens the scene, geometry and multiple viewpoints allow us to reconstruct depth and shape.  

Topics we will cover include:  
- **Stereo vision**: using two cameras or viewpoints to infer depth  
- **Structure from motion (SfM)**: recovering 3D structure from video or multiple images  
- **Vanishing points and perspective geometry**  
- **Shape-from-X methods** (shading, texture, silhouettes)  

By the end of this theme, you will understand how 3D perception emerges from geometric cues and how these methods are applied in robotics, AR/VR, and 3D modeling.

### Recap (what you should take away)  
- 2D images are projections of the 3D world.  
- Depth can be inferred using geometry, motion, or shading cues.  
- Stereo and motion-based approaches are key to modern 3D vision.  
- These ideas are the foundation of technologies like self-driving cars, SLAM, and 3D reconstruction.

### Stop to think  
Close one eye and look around — how does your depth perception change compared to when using both eyes? What does this tell us about the importance of **multiple viewpoints** in 3D vision?
